        <p>Information that you shared during registration such as your name, email, username and pass phrase. Pass phrases are salted and hashed which means they can not be read back and are therefor safe.</p>

        <p>The application stores an access token that is created when you log in. It is there to ensure that it's you who wants to view your previously logged moods or asking for an intention before your meditation.</p>
        <h3>Can I remove my data?</h3>
        <p>On your profile page under "Practice" - "My practice", you will find a link you can use if you would like to delete your account. This will also delete all your previously logged moods.</p>
